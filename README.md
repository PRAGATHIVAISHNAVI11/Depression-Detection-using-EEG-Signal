# Depression-Detection-using-EEG-Signal
Depression-detection
This project focuses on detecting depression from EEG data using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and providing personalized recommendations based on user survey responses. It integrates EEG signal classification, mental health survey assessment, and a GUI built with Tkinter.

ðŸ§  Overview EEG Signal Processing: Reads EEG datasets in .csv format and preprocesses them for classification.

CNN Model: Detects depression using a deep learning model trained on EEG features.

Survey Module: Collects additional self-reported symptoms using a 4-question Likert scale survey.

Recommendation System: Offers tailored mental health suggestions based on survey scores.

GUI: User-friendly Tkinter interface to handle EEG upload, prediction, survey, and display results.

ðŸ”§ Features Load and process EEG data from CSV files.

Automatically train or load a CNN for depression detection.

Predict whether the EEG signals indicate "Normal" or "Depressed".

Provide a 4-question mental health survey with score interpretation.

Suggest mental health recommendations based on survey score.

ðŸ“Š How It Works EEG Upload: User uploads EEG data via the GUI.

Model Prediction: Data is passed through a CNN to classify depression.

User Survey: After selecting a record, the user completes a brief survey.

Recommendation: Based on average survey score:

Score < 2: Positive mental health message

Score 2â€“4: Mild support suggestions (e.g., mindfulness, exercise)

Score > 4: Recommend therapy or guided mental health support

ðŸ›  Requirements

Python 3.x

numpy, pandas, keras, tensorflow, sklearn

tkinter (built-in for most Python installs) ðŸ“ˆ Dataset The project assumes the input EEG dataset:

Is a .csv file.

Contains numerical EEG features with the last column labeled as "Label" (0 or 1).

ðŸ§ª CNN Architecture Conv2D with 32 filters (3x3)

MaxPooling2D

Flatten layer

Dense (256 units, ReLU)

Output Dense layer with 2 classes (Softmax)

ðŸ“Œ Limitations Currently works only with EEG features formatted in 18x18x3 shape.

Survey is basic; can be extended to use validated psychological scales (e.g., PHQ-9).

Not a substitute for professional mental health diagnosis.
